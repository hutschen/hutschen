Hi, my name is Helmar Hutschenreuter and I am working in the field of information security or IT security. I have a passion for software development, particularly using Python. I enjoy building web applications with Angular and Typescript and designing APIs. As a software developer, my goal is to develop tools that make the work of information security experts easier, so that the IT systems we use daily become more secure.
